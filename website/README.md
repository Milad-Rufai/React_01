Question 4: What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

    - in JSX, you must return a single parent element, or it won't compile. In HTML, you don’t have to return a single parent element.
    - You can implement JS directly in JSX by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. In HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
    - To define class names and for attributes in JSX, you don't use "class" or "for", both are reserved keywords in JavaScript.
    - You need to write all HTML attributes and event references in camelCase while writing JSX. 


Question 5: Why can’t browsers read JSX?

    - This is because JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
